# Project I -- The Over-crowded American Prison System
## A forecast model for US prisoner population

The U.S. government incarcerates over 1,500,000 inmates in the prison system, which is the largest in the world and keeps growing. Amid concerns about the unsustainable growth of our prison system, begging in the 1980s, prison privatization became a booming industry under government programs to cut back on the federal workforce. The Justice Departments has been contracting private prison corporations for the incarceration of prisoners.

To provide clients of the private prison industry a status report of the current market, this project aims to survey the prisoner population dynamics of the U.S. justice and correction system, and summarize the longitudinal trends of incarceration. A forecast model is built by learning the pattern presented in past data and to predict change of the prisoner population in the future. This study can offer important information for business decision for clients and investors in the prison industry, such as regional expansion of revenue and contract for operation of custody facilities in the future.
